    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Sauté ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and
        crumbly; 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a
        rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the
        bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain and discard any fat from the cooked beef. Stir condensed soup and
        garlic powder into the beef. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring
        occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove beef from the heat. Add egg noodles and stir to combine. Stir in
        sour cream and season with salt and pepper.
