    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This juicy air fryer meatloaf is easy to make in a fraction of the time
      compared to cooking a meatloaf in the oven. Serve with your favorite sauce
      and mashed potatoes for a comforting meal.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons dry bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 mushrooms, thickly sliced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an air fryer to 392 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Combine ground beef, onion, bread crumbs, thyme, egg, salt, and pepper
        in a bowl. Knead and mix thoroughly. Transfer mixture to a small loaf
        pan. Smooth the top, press in mushrooms, and coat with olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast meatloaf in the preheated air fryer until nicely browned, about 25
        minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
        read at least 165 degrees F (72 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour oil into a large baking dish; add the breaded chicken thighs and
        sprinkle with paprika to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let meatloaf rest at least 10 minutes before slicing into wedges and
        serving.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
